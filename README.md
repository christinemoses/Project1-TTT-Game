# Project1-TTT-Game

  An interactive, multiplayer tic-tac-toe game completed as part of General Assembly's WDI program.

## Technologies

  I used HTML and CSS to creat the game design.
  I used Javascript to create the game functionality.
  I used jquery to incorporate event handlers.
  I used Ajax to connect to the game API provided to me for the project.

## Planning

  User Story:

    As a Tic Tac Toe game player, I want to play a browser game with a friend.

      As a user, I can register for an account.
      As a user, I can log in to my account.
      As a user, I can clear the board and play a new game.
      As a user, I can view the rules of the game.
      AS a user, I can see a notification of who won the game.
